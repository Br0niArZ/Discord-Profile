## How to start
NOTE: At the outset, I would like to emphasize that the following instructions are not a "3 easy steps" type of guide. To achieve success, one must also engage their brain.

1. **Download:** Download the repository from the [official source](https://github.com/Br0niArZ/Discord-Profile/releases).
2. **Configuration:** Configure the configuration file located in ``config.json``.
3. **Hosting:** Host the website on web servers such as nginx/apache2.
4. **Join our Discord server:** [discord.gg/7E52CFKaET](https://discord.gg/7E52CFKaET)
5. **Voila!** This way, you have launched a Discord profile on your website that is updated in real-time!

## Why join a Discord server?
We regret to inform you that joining our Discord is necessary. Without this step, the API will be unable to obtain any information regarding your Discord account. We will regularly update the project, so in case of any changes in this matter, we will keep you informed.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
